#+TITLE: Wine Linked Data

This document describes the UC Davis Wine linked database  This includes the
ontology, some examples, and some workflow information.

* Wine Ontology

The first item of business is some standard prefixes for our ontology.  We will be using some owl
reasoning, so we include that.  We will also be comparing this to some dbpedia
objects as well, so those need to be included.


#+BEGIN_SRC n3 :tangle wine-ontology.owl
@prefix rdf:  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .

#+END_SRC


OK, let's start with some of the most basic aspects of Wine. Here we will define
the Wine class, and identify is as being the same as some other examples,
dbpedia for example.

#+BEGIN_SRC :tangle wine-ontology.owl
:Wine a owl:Class;
= wd:Q282;
wdt:P646 <https://g.co/kg/m/081qc>.

# We also allow wine labels to be rdf labels
:label a owl:Class;
 = rdf:label.

#+END_SRC

We can first define wine by it's major type.  These divide still, sparkling and
fortified wines.  We also include dessert wines, since they are part of the US
wine type categories.  Note that the domain of this is supposed to verify that
we can only use that type from our list.

#+BEGIN_SRC n3 :tangle wine-ontology.owl
  :WineType a rdf:Class.

  :StillWine a :WineType;
  rdf:label "Still Wine"@en.

  :SparklingWine a :WineType;
  = wdt:Q321263 ;
  rdf:label "Sparkling Wine"@en.

  :DessertWine a :WineType;
  = wdt:Q321263 ;
  rdf:label :Dessert Wine"@en;
  rdf:description: "According to the TTB https://www.ttb.gov/wine/wine-labeling.shtml, Table Wine (if no more than 14% alcohol by
volume) or Dessert Wine (if over 14% alcohol by volume)."@en.

  :FortifiedWine a :WineType;
  = wdt:Q722338;
  rdf:label "Fortified Wine"@en.

  :type a rdf:Property;
  rdfs:domain :Wine;
  rdfs:range :WineType.

#+END_SRC

Wine can also be described by it's color.  Similar to the type, there is only a
limited number of these to choose from.

#+BEGIN_SRC n3 :tangle wine-ontology.owl
# We also have three Wine Colors
:WineColor a rdf:Class.

:RedWine a :WineColor;
rdf:label "Red"@en.

:RoseWine a :WineColor;
rdf:label "Rose".

:WhiteWine a :WineColor;
rdf:label "White"@en.

:color a rdf:Property;
rdfs:domain :Wine;
rdfs:range :WineColor.

#+END_SRC

Next, we have some other properties specific to a general wine.  These  include
the alcohol content, and the address of the winery.

#+BEGIN_SRC n3 :tangle wine-ontology.owl
:alcohol a rdf:Property;
         rdfs:domain :Wine;
         rdfs:label "Alcohol Content";

:nameAndAddress a rdf:Property;
         rdfs:domain :Wine;
         rdf:label "address";
				 = wdt:Q319608.

** US Wines

Somewhere around 1978, we I need to check, new regulations came out in terms of
the types of infomation that could be included on a label.  These allow us to be
more specific with our descriptions of a wine, from investigation of the label.
Right now, I'm allowing some of these attributes to be used on general wine labels.

#+BEGIN_SRC n3 :tangle wine-ontology.owl
:US_Wine_1978 a rdf:Class;
                  owl:subClass :Wine;

# Although this is from US, we are allowing it to be described

                  rdf:description "Varietal designations are the names of the dominant grapes used in the wine. Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Zinfandel, and Merlot are examples of grape varieties.

:addressQualification a rdf:Property;

* Examples

Below are a few examples of some wine definitions.  We include a number of wine
labels from the Amarine collection, as well as an example from Opus One.  The
examples below use the [[https://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/n3/][Notation3 (N3)]] format.  This about the most clear syntax
that I could find for this linked data markup.  If you are interested in how it
may look in other formats, you can see this [[http://rdf-translator.appspot.com/][RDF Translator]] to modify it.

First, we need to define our prefixes.  Since we are using two different
collections, there are two different prefixes in the examples below.

This is from the Amerine collection, [[https://labelthis.lib.ucdavis.edu/view/0172][Label 0172]]. Note that this example has the
Sonoma Winery identified as a anonymous winery.   This is another method of

** Opus One

Our Opus One example has a number of vintages starting in 1979, of one of the
most famous wines from the United States.  Here, much of the information comes
from the website, in particular the vintage blends as it does from the the label
itself.  Also note that the vintage blends can take precedent over the label
constituents.

This example starts to examine the wine maker as well, though only briefly.

* Processing Workflow

In addition to the information related to the wine itself, we also need to
include information about the workflow that in the end determines the data in
the database.  This is especially important in the context where some of the
data is derived from crowd sourced data.  In addition, some of this information
can be used by other utilities.

*** Suggestions

In a crowd sourced environment, a single user will make a suggestion on the
potential markup for a particular label.  We will encompass this information in
a separate rdf graph.  When the suggestion is made to the server, the graph designation
separates that data from all other suggestions, and makes uniquely identifies
the suggestions.


Inside the suggestions, properties are identified in a manner similar to that as
defined in [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4350149/][this paper about singleton properties]].  Because, by the RDF standard,
properties are not allowed to be blank/anonymous nodes, we seperate out the
singletonProperties as names items with local counter to designate all the
different components.  Each property contains the property it
is a singletonPropertyOf, as well as information about how this property was
determined.  In our case, this latter part comes from the process, textOnLabel,
which identifies the part of the label where the text was found.

Here is a more complete example of a previous example as a suggestion made
regarding a particular label.
